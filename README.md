This is an absolutely terrible pile of hacks I'm using to "re-reverse engineer" the "Starlet" co-processor
that the Wii uses for some IO, all of the security, and the initial boot and initialization of most of the
hardware (think the DDR memory config, initializing/loading boot code for the main PPC chip, etc.)

What follows is just a dump of my thoughts, most of this will probably be recollected into a more interesting
and specific blog post someday. (Moved to NOTES.md)
